# Network-Science
Build networks using graph theory knowledge and R codes.

A pdf report on the project I conducted throughout my Network Science course is attached. My aim was to study the networks
of the pre, during and post-COVID-19 periods constructed using the stocks in the Consumer Products and Services sector of Bursa Malaysia. 
Many different types of analyses regarding financial networks and the implementation of graph theory are portrayed through the project.
